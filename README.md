# isol8 

> IN PROGRESS

`isol8` is a tool to isolate your web components before distribution/publishing.

It can do things like replace image refs with base64 uris, inline styling, etc. **without** bundling your component. All this to allow strong isolation of your web components and simplify their consumption.
